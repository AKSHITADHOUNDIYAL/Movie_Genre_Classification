# üé¨ Movie_Genre_Classification

This project aims to classify movies into different genres based on provided metadata such as movie titles, overviews, tags, and more. It applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to predict the appropriate genres for a given movie description.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset for this project must be **imported from Kaggle**.

You can find and download the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb) by searching for **Movie Genre Classification** datasets.  
After downloading, place the data files in the appropriate project directory (`/data/` or the specified path in the code).

> **Note:** Make sure you have a Kaggle account to access and download the dataset.
